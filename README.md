## Introduction:
Welcome to the **Calculator** project! This web-based responsive calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, can fully proform in any size screen devices, making it a handy tool for everyday calculations. Whether you need to add, subtract, multiply, or divide, this calculator provides an intuitive interface and quick functionality.

## Project Overview:
This project was developed as part of the CS50 course from Harvard University. The goal was to create a fully functional and responsive calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator supports the following features:

- **Basic arithmetic operations:** addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The ability to clear the current input or delete the last entry.
- Responsive design to ensure usability across different devices.

## Technologies Used:
The Calculator project is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML:** The structure of the web application is created using HTML. The markup defines the calculator's interface, including buttons and input fields.
- **CSS:** The styling of the calculator is done using CSS. Custom styles enhance the visual appeal and user experience by applying layout, color schemes, and transitions.
- **JavaScript:** The interactivity of the calculator is handled through JavaScript. Functions are implemented to manage user inputs, perform calculations, and display results.

## Features:
The Calculator project includes the following features:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** The calculator has a simple and clean design, making it easy for users to input numbers and select operations.

2. **Basic Operations:** Users can perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)
   - Percentage(`%`)

3. **Input Validation:** The calculator validates user input to ensure that only valid entries are processed. If an invalid input is detected, an alert message is displayed to guide the user.

4. **Clear and Delete Functions:** Users can clear the entire input or delete the last digit with dedicated buttons.

5. **Responsive Design:** The calculator is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.

6. **Theme Options:** Users can choose different themes (e.g., light mode, dark mode) that enhance personalization.

## How to Use:
To use the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. You will see a display area at the top of the calculator where results are shown.
3. Click on the number buttons (0-9) to input your desired numbers.
4. Select an arithmetic operation button (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to choose the operation you want to perform.
5. Continue entering numbers and operations as needed.
6. Click the `=` button to calculate and display the result.
7. Use the `C` button to clear the input or the `D` button to delete the last entry.

## Installation:
To run the Calculator project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd calculator
3. **Open the HTML File:** Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the calculator.

## Live Demo:
  You can also access a live demo of the Calculator project at *(your-live-demo-link.com)*. This demo showcases all the features mentioned and allows you to interact with the calculator directly.

## Future Improvements:
  While the current version of the calculator is functional, there are several enhancements that can be made in future iterations:

1. **Advanced Functions:** Adding scientific calculator features such as square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric functions could expand the calculator's usability.

2. **History Functionality:** Implementing a history feature that allows users to view their previous calculations could improve the overall user experience.

3. **Keyboard Support:** Allowing keyboard input for numbers and operations could improve accessibility and usability.

## Conclusion:
  The Calculator project serves as a practical application of web development skills acquired during the CS50 course. It combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully functional web-based calculator that is easy to use and visually appealing. The project demonstrates the importance of user experience in web applications and lays the groundwork for future enhancements.
